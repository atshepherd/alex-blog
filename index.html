        <h1>Welcome to Alex's Blog!</h1>
            <p><strong>About: </strong>This blog will detail my journey of <em>relearning</em> to code, and becoming a successful web developer or Software Engineer.</p>
        <h2> Day 1: The First Post</h2>
        <h3><em>- March 30th, 2025 10:30AM EST -</em></h3>
            <p>Good morning! My name is Alexander Shepherd, but you can call me Alex. This blog, (first created as a short project recommended by TheOdinProject in the HTML Fundamentals lesson) will be a place to document my journey of relearning to code and <em>hopefully</em> securing a job as a web developer or SWE. I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, and I currently work as a Technical Services Administrator, which is basically just my company's way of saying that I work on the helpdesk. I provide phone/chat technical support, perform password resets, and handle onboarding/offboarding of employees. Since I started, I have went out of my way to take on opportunities to learn and accept new responsibilities. For example, I've worked on our company audits to ensure compliance with regulations, and most recently, I have started creating and improving the technical documentation that our team uses to perform their day-to-day duties. This requires a deep understanding of how to correctly perform our procedures, as well as the knowledge of how the programs we use as admins, and the programs that our agents use are interconnected to allow the company operations to run smoothly.</p>

            <p>So, <em>why</em> am I doing this? I've decided that I want much more than what my role can currently offer me. Unfortunately, there is not much room for growth within this particular department, and I'm not particularly fulfilled by the work I do in my day-to-day. While I <em>was</em> exposed to quite a few programming languages and worked on various projects in college, nothing ever really stuck with me. I was unfocused and didn't take the time to truly understand the skills I was being taught. Because I was working a full-time job at the time, I declined to take on any internships (which I now regret), and continued with the customer service role I was currently in. I managed to secure my CompTIA A+ certification, and I also was able to gain management experience as I moved up to a supervisor level for around 6 months. This temp role taught me a lot, but I ultimately moved away from that role so I could join the tech team for the role I am in now. As I mentioned previously though, there isn't much of a future for me in this current role. I want to be with a company that I can grow and develop with long-term, and I want to do work that is more fulfilling to me. One thing I left out at the beginning of this post, is that I was <strong>originally a CS major.</strong> I switched from CS to IT due to my inability to face my struggles with the difficulty of the program head-on. This is a skill I have developed since then, and I have developed a <strong>growth mindset</strong> towards new challenges now. I was a "smart" kid in school, and it took a while to get over the idea that everything should just come naturally to me.</p>
            
            <p>When I was a kid, I always wanted to work in a field that focused on computers and technology. I enjoy creating things, like games or websites, and I like to take on new problems and come up with solutions. TheOdinProject is my first foray back into the world of programming, and by the end of it, I will be able to confidently say that I can create websites, and proudly list skills such as <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em> on my resume (something that is currently lacking, in my own opinion). From there, who knows what I'll take on next? Taking this first step is more than just a challenge to learn a few new skills. It's proof to myself that I <em>can</em> do whatever I set my mind to. To remind myself that I can be successful if I just put in the work. Not everything comes naturally, and it's in the face of new challenges that real progress is made.</p>

            <p>If you made it this far, thank you for reading my story and learning a bit more about my <em>why</em> for going on this journey. Future posts <em>probably</em> won't be this long...I'm committing to documenting this journey to look back on later, and what better medium to do so than a website, where I can practice the very skills I am learning?</p>

            <p>Anyway, I should wrap this up, I'm going to go spend some time with my brother and my mom, who is currently being treated for liver cancer. Truly hoping that she makes a recovery and is able to go into remission. Cancer is no joke, and it's never easy watching your parents grow old. Thanks for reading, and have a great rest of your day. :)</p>
