        <h1>Welcome to My Blog!</h1>
            <p><strong>About: </strong>My name is Alex, and I am writing this blog to detail my journey of <em>relearning</em> to code, and becoming a successful web developer or Software Engineer.</p>

        <h2>Day 2: Balance</h2>
        <h3><em>- March 31st, 2025 10:28PM EST -</em></h3>
            <p>Today is a day all about balancing the responsibilities of life. I find when life gets busy, that's the most important time to maintain your good habits. If you can do the hard work when you're busy, then it becomes an effortless habit over time. I took some time as I could today on breaks and lunches to study up my next section on links and images. I knew a bit about how to implement these features before, but the cool part was actually learning the <em>why</em> behind certain things, such as the need for alt text on images to ensure accessibility, or using the rel tag to stop hyperlinked pages from using JavaScript to manipulate the original page. I really value being able to take my time to fully understand these concepts piece by piece, and I think it is all part of the puzzle of being a successful developer. To demonstrate the newly learned skills, I added a picture of myself up by the header, and some alt text for good measure. <a href="#me">Check it out!</a></p>

            <p>On top of building the habit of coding every day, and taking the time to go through this course alongside my normal full-time job, I am also proud to be keeping up with my fitness habits (I'm currently writing this on a walking pad, completing my goal of 10k steps daily). Today marks week 2 of a new workout routine, and I crushed some previous PR's that I've been sitting on for a while. It's cool to see what happens when you push yourself. I've been going to the gym off and on for a couple years now, but life has always got in the way of consistency. That changes this year. </p>

            <p>Not as much to cover today. I went a bit off-topic, but I had to take a second to be proud of myself (And if you haven't done so recently, I suggest you do the same. You deserve it!). Feeling very motivated and excited for what's to come. Thank you for reading.

        <h2>Day 1: The First Post</h2>
        <h3><em>- March 30th, 2025 10:30AM EST -</em></h3>
            <p>Good morning! My name is Alexander Shepherd, but you can call me Alex. This blog, (first created as a short project recommended by TheOdinProject in the HTML Fundamentals lesson) will be a place to document my journey of relearning to code and <em>hopefully</em> securing a job as a web developer or SWE. I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, and I currently work as a Technical Services Administrator, which is basically just my company's way of saying that I work on the helpdesk. I provide phone/chat technical support, perform password resets, and handle onboarding/offboarding of employees. Since I started, I have went out of my way to take on opportunities to learn and accept new responsibilities. For example, I've worked on our company audits to ensure compliance with regulations, and most recently, I have started creating and improving the technical documentation that our team uses to perform their day-to-day duties. This requires a deep understanding of how to correctly perform our procedures, as well as the knowledge of how the programs we use as admins, and the programs that our agents use are interconnected to allow the company operations to run smoothly.</p>

            <p>So, <em>why</em> am I doing this? I've decided that I want much more than what my role can currently offer me. Unfortunately, there is not much room for growth within this particular department, and I'm not particularly fulfilled by the work I do in my day-to-day. While I <em>was</em> exposed to quite a few programming languages and worked on various projects in college, nothing ever really stuck with me. I was unfocused and didn't take the time to truly understand the skills I was being taught. Because I was working a full-time job at the time, I declined to take on any internships (which I now regret), and continued with the customer service role I was currently in. I managed to secure my CompTIA A+ certification, and I also was able to gain management experience as I moved up to a supervisor level for around 6 months. This temp role taught me a lot, but I ultimately moved away from that role so I could join the tech team for the role I am in now. As I mentioned previously though, there isn't much of a future for me in this current role. I want to be with a company that I can grow and develop with long-term, and I want to do work that is more fulfilling to me. One thing I left out at the beginning of this post, is that I was <strong>originally a CS major.</strong> I switched from CS to IT due to my inability to face my struggles with the difficulty of the program head-on. This is a skill I have developed since then, and I have developed a <strong>growth mindset</strong> towards new challenges now. I was a "smart" kid in school, and it took a while to get over the idea that everything should just come naturally to me.</p>
            
            <p>When I was a kid, I always wanted to work in a field that focused on computers and technology. I enjoy creating things, like games or websites, and I like to take on new problems and come up with solutions. TheOdinProject is my first foray back into the world of programming, and by the end of it, I will be able to confidently say that I can create websites, and proudly list skills such as <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em> on my resume (something that is currently lacking, in my own opinion). From there, who knows what I'll take on next? Taking this first step is more than just a challenge to learn a few new skills. It's proof to myself that I <em>can</em> do whatever I set my mind to. To remind myself that I can be successful if I just put in the work. Not everything comes naturally, and it's in the face of new challenges that real progress is made.</p>

            <p>If you made it this far, thank you for reading my story and learning a bit more about my <em>why</em> for going on this journey. Future posts <em>probably</em> won't be this long...I'm committing to documenting this journey to look back on later, and what better medium to do so than a website, where I can practice the very skills I am learning?</p>

            <p>Anyway, I should wrap this up, I'm going to go spend some time with my brother and my mom, who is currently being treated for liver cancer. Truly hoping that she makes a recovery and is able to go into remission. Cancer is no joke, and it's never easy watching your parents grow old. Thanks for reading, and have a great rest of your day. :)</p>
